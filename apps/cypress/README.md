## Running Tests

For now, unfortunately you cannot run the tests inside docker since it needs further configuration which will be added in the future.

So to run the tests, you need to create an external cypress project on your machine, then copy the `cypress` file found in `apps/cypress/` into your project.

Please refer to [Cypress Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) to initialize a project.
